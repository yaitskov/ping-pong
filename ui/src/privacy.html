    which is provided by users explicitly (filing web forms),
    or implicitly. This information is used to please users as much as possible.
    Though keep in mind that accidental data leaks
    are possible, due bugs in software or its configuration,
    which could be exploited by evil hackers or rivals.
    In that case Cloud-Sport cannot give any warranty how user data could be used.
</p>

<p>
    Cloud-Sport is integrated with 3rd party systems like
    Speech Recognition from <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
    and <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> social network.
    Those systems could receive user data or provide them to Cloud-Sport.

<p>
    A Cloud-Sport user could request all his data removal from the system,
    by filing <a href="https://github.com/yaitskov/ping-pong/issues">an issue</a>.
